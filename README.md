# Django template for v3.11.4

This is my django project and the goal is to easily start a project with common functionalities like authentication, authorization, registration, and etc. Also deploy it as easy as possible.

UPDATE: zappa does not support python 3.11 yet.
Django==4.2.4 does not support postgres 12 or lower so I'm using Djanog==4.1.0

I'm currently using [readme.so](https://readme.so/) to create this README.md file.

deployed here: https://gcxw2bzlyg.execute-api.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/dev
