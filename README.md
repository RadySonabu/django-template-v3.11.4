# Django template for v3.11.4

This is my django project and the goal is to easily start a project with common functionalities like authentication, authorization, registration, and etc. Also deploy it as easy as possible.

UPDATE: zappa does not support python 3.11 yet. So I will use python 3.10 env

I'm currently using [readme.so](https://readme.so/) to create this README.md file.
